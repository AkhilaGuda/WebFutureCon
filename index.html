                <p>The rapid evolution of AI and Quantum Computing is reshaping the security landscape, challenging
                    traditional models, and demanding a paradigm shift in product security. AI is a double-edged sword,
                    empowering defenders while simultaneously enhancing attackers’ ability to automate, evade detection,
                    and steal sensitive data. Quantum Computing, on the other hand, threatens to break modern
                    cryptographic standards, requiring proactive preparation to secure the future. This session will
                    provide practical insights and a roadmap to help security leaders leverage AI for defense, mitigate
                    emerging AI risks, and transition toward quantum-resistant architectures before threats become
                    reality.</p>
